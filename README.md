# Triathlon Awards Determiner

This program calculates the total time taken by a participant to complete a triathlon, and determines the award they would receive based on their performance. The awards categories are modeled in a playful nod to the classic Robin Hood characters, in the spirit of the event setting, the "Nottingham Annual Robin Hood Triathlon".

## Features

- Collects individual times for swimming, cycling, and running from the user.
- Calculates the total time for the triathlon.
- Provides colorful and expressive feedback, awarding a participant one of the "Provincial" prizes based on their total time.

## Installation

No special installation steps required. You just need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Usage

```bash
python3 triathlon_awards.py
```

This command will start the program, and you will be asked to enter the times for the swimming, cycling, and running events. Ensure that you enter the times in minutes.

### Sample Input

```bash
Swimming: 20
Cycling: 30
Running: 40
```

### Sample Output

```bash
Welcome all merry men, women and gender diverse humans to the Nottingham Annual Robin Hood Triathlon!
Can you give us the times in minutes for all three events please?
It took you just 90.0 min to complete the triathlon my good fellow! Just about right and
CONGRATULATIONS!!! You WON Provincial COLOURS!
